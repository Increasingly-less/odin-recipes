# Project 0001 - Odin-recipes

This project is a practice piece created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The individual goals reside in the build itself, and the content is irrelevant/inaccurate. In short, this is to practice building with HTML, coding with VSC, and using git commit workflows in the process. It aims to help me learn HTML and build a portfolio item showcasing my skills.
